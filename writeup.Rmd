##Introduction

The data set and problem set up for this project is provided by [kaggle.com] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification) . From this website, "Walmart uses both art and science to continually make progress on their core mission of better understanding and serving their customers. One way Walmart is able to improve customers' shopping experiences is by segmenting their store visits into different trip types." A motivation for the statistical analysis in this project is to provide a company like Walmart with interesting information  and insights regarding their customers. The kaggle competition includes a training and a testing set where the goal is to classify different types of shopping trips in the testing set with information provided in the training set. 

##Data 

The data has transactional data for customers shopping at Walmart. 

The data consists of 7 columns: TripType, VisitNumber, Weekday, Upc, ScanCount, DepartmentDescription, and FinelineNumber. The TripType is an id that represents the type of trip the customer made. This is the variable we are going to be predicting. The VisitNumber is an id depicting a trip made by a customer. Weekday is the weekday of the trip. UPC which is the Unique Product Code is the unique code associated with the product. ScanCount is the quantity of that particular item bought. A negative value here means the item was returned. DepartmentDescription is a broad description of the item's department. FinelineNumber is a more refined category for each of the products, created by Walmart.

Each shopping trip is categorised based on the items purchased in each trip. For example: a trip may be small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, or a holiday trip.

There's two sets of data: the training set and the test set. The training set contains the trips with the TripType included. There are a total of 38 distinct trip types that Walmart has come up with. And the data has 65,535 rows.

Using the columns in the Test data, we need to come up with categorising/clustering the test data into trip types. And finally predict a TripType for each of the customer trips in the test data.


##Data Visualilzation and Shiny App

First, we looked at different ways to visualize the datasets. The Shiny App contains three different plots where various inputs can be changed, and the plots will automatically change. The Shiny App can be found online on RStudio's hosting service for Shiny apps here: [Shiny App] (https://snormoyle.shinyapps.io/Final_Project_STA523). In all three plots, the dataset can either be chosen as the training set or the testing set. The step that takes the longest to load in the App is selecting one of these two datasets because they have almost 700,000 rows each. Descriptions of the three different plots are as follows:


1. Basket Size by Day Bargraph: 

For this plot, the user can select a minimum basket size and a maximum basket size. This plot was intended to be able to look to see during which days of the week people shop most often and also to see if this changes for different types of shopping trips. We hypothesize that people in general shop more often on the weekdays, and in addition, people shop more often for big baskets on the weekends.  

This bargraph shows the proportion of the all trips on that day next to the proportion with that specified basket size that occured on that day. You can see how the propotion with the specified basket changes compared to the total proportion. Is it seen that overall, most people shop on weekdays, and in addition, a greater proportion shops for big baskets on weekends. Negative items or baskets sizes are returns. 


2. Department by Weekday Bargraph: 

For this plot, the user can either select all the departemtn or can select the desired departments. The total heights of this bargraph shows the total frequency of items bought per weekdays. The stacked colors of each bargraph show the proportion of the different selected deparments. The user can see how the proportion of items bought from different departments changes on different weekdays.  

3. Department Relationship Chart:

On this plot, the user can select the different desired departments. This plot shows the relationship between the departments and how often people buy items in those departments at the same time. On the x and y axis are the selected departments creating a matrix between all the selected departments. The shaded sqaures within this matrix show the relationship between them. The darker the shade of blue, the more related those departments are and the more often customers buy products from those different departments. 


##Cleaning and Organzing Data

The data was cleaned and organized in order to use it better for a classification algorithm. The data for each visit number is now: 

1. visit number
2. number of purchases
3. number of returns
4. weekday
5. indicators for the specific departments for the trip
6. indicators for the fine line numbers for the trip, which is a more descriptive categorizing number than the department for each item
