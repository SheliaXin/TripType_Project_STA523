Write-up for the project can be found in writeup.Rmd. The Shiny App can be found in ui.R and server.R, but the link to the more user friendly deployed Shiny App can also be found in the write-up.

The submissons ready to be sent to kaggle.com can be found in the two .csv files, submission.csv and submission_r.csv.

If you want to re-run the code for the final analysis part of the project, it can be re-run with the Makefile.
